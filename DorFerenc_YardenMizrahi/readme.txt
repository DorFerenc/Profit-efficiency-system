* in any part of the program if there is an error you will not be able to click "Next" or will not get the "Operation was successful" message *

2) Now you can see the efficiency data by role or department

	- click "By Role" or "By Department" (under the "Only efficiency data" label)

	- you will see how each role or department affects the efficiency and how it sums up to the total effect on the company
